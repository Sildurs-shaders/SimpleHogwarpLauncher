Simple batch launcher for Hogwarp: https://twitter.com/HogWarp

## Installation:
1. Move the Phoenix and Polyjuice folder from Hogwarp in to the SimpleHogwarpLauncher folder.
2. Move the SimpleHogwarpLauncher folder in to your Hogwarts Legacy folder.
3. Use the SimpleHogwarpLauncher.bat file to launch the game with hogwarp enabled.

Note: The console window will stay open till hogwarts is closed, moving all the files back into the HogwarpLauncher folder, leaving your game in a clean unmodded state.
