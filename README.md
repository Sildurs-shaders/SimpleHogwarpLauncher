## SimpleHogwarpLauncher
Simple batch launcher for Hogwarp: https://twitter.com/HogWarp
Automatically moves all the required files for hogwarp and launches the game. Waiting for the process to end and move the files back into the SimpleHogwarpLauncher folder. Keeping your game files clean and unmodded.

## Installation:
1. Move the Phoenix and Polyjuice folder from Hogwarp in to the SimpleHogwarpLauncher folder.
2. Move the SimpleHogwarpLauncher folder in to your Hogwarts Legacy folder.
3. Use the SimpleHogwarpLauncher.bat file to launch the game with hogwarp enabled.

Note: The console window will stay open till hogwarts is closed, moving all the files back into the HogwarpLauncher folder, leaving your game in a clean unmodded state.

## Todo:
- Epic games version support is untested..
- Maybe use registry to find the hogwarts folder, making the launcher work globally.
- ???
