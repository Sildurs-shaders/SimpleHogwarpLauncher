## SimpleHogwarpLauncher
Simple batch launcher for Hogwarp

## Installation:
1. Move the Phoenix and Polyjuice folder from Hogwarp in to the HogwarpLauncher folder.
2. Move the HogwarpLauncher folder in to your Hogwarts Legacy folder.
3. Use the HogwarpLauncher.bat file to launch the game with hogwarp enabled.

Note: The console window will stay open till hogwarts is closed, moving all the files back into the HogwarpLauncher folder, leaving your game in a clean unmodded state.
